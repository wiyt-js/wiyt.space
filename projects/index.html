                    </div>
                    <p>I have much experience with designing in a few different programming languages and creating full exernal applications and easy-to-use user interface menus.</p>
                    <img id="screenshot-mooshapp" src="../res/img/screenshot-mooshapp.png" alt=""/>
                    <p>I created this application called 'Moosh App' along with an old friend of mine as an applet to help with my virtual model during my streams. I sketched out the design and we worked hand-in-hand to create it using only Java.</p>
                    <p>This extremely useful application is utilized in my streams still to this day. It hooks into the VTube Studio, OBS Studio and Twitch PubSub (which I will soon be migrating to EventSub later this year) websockets and communicates with each other to accomplish certain tasks.</p>
                    <p>It can do a multitude of events like hide or move the position of a model based on if a certain OBS scene is viewed, update the color of a currently loaded model and apply certain effects using the VTube Studio API.</p>

                    </video>
                    <p>The video above is of an old Minecraft client I created called Meta. It contains 80+ features as well as many different customizable options when it comes to the coloring and how you want your GUI to look.</p>

                    <p>These images above are of a couple of the main menus I made for my clients. I used to go under the alias 'Aqua' during most of my years playing Minecraft.</p>
                    <p>I created these as custom projects for one of my now-defunct Minecraft YouTube channel.</p>
                    <p>I have had the pleasure and opportunity of designing a full website for a few companies where I am hailing from.</p>
                    <p>I have also once created a RedBubble account and uploaded a bunch of custom designed t-shirts and designs on many different items, attaining thousands of dollars in the process.</p>
                    <p>More pictures will soon be added to this webpage.</p>
